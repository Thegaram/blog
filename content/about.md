## Current projects

I'm building [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) because I believe e-learning for back-end developers is a neglected area of focus, and should include more computer science fundamentals. E-learning for programmers can be a lot better by mixing the most appropriate mediums of learning. Learning should feel like a game, and it should be *very* hands-on.
