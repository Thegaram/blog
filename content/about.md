I've been writing code since 2010, first in Python, then primarily in Go and JavaScript. I've spent most of my career as a backend developer and data engineer. After a couple of years leading teams of Go developers, I'm now working full-time on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev). I help new developers learn back-end development and start successful careers.
