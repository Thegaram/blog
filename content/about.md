I've been writing code since 2010, first in Python, then primarily in Go and JavaScript. I've spent most of my career as a cloud-native backend developer, but I also write React and Vue for my various side projects. After a couple of years leading teams of Go developers, I'm now working full-time on [Boot.dev](https://boot.dev) helping new developers learn back-end engineering and computer science.
