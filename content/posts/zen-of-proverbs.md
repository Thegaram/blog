20 of my rules of thumb for writing better software.

* Optimize for simplicity first
* Write code for humans, not computers
* Reading is more important than writing
* Any style is fine, as long as it's black
* There should be one way to do it, but seriously this time
* Hide the sharp knives
* Changing the rules is better than adding exceptions
* Libraries are better than frameworks
* Transitive dependencies are a problem
* Dynamic runtime dependencies are a bigger problem
* The surface area of an API is a liability
* Returning early is a good thing
* Plain text is usually best
* Compiler errors are better than runtime errors
* Runtime errors are better than bugs
* Tooling is better than documentation
* Documentation is better than nothing
* Configuration sucks, but so does convention
* The cost of building a feature is its smallest cost
* Types are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
